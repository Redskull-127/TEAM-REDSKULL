# TRACK 5 : CY-BOCK

# INTRODUCTION :
  - <p align="center">As the crime are increasing in the today`s world, where it is a cyber crime or physical crime it is important to manage the information of such criminal activities in a proper way so that police associates can get help from this data to solve case easily. so by taking this perspective in our mind our team has created a web application to store and retrive the data of such criminals.

The main motive of this project is to give the ease of Technology to the Cops to manage the Data related to Criminals and Crime. We also focused on the making the process of finding data related to criminals easier. By asking for different attributes related to the Criminal and Crime while creating a new record helps us to make finding the record easier by using attributes to our need like hair color, birth mark, tattoo, any special traits and many more to that.

However, the workload quickly became too much for one person, that`s we have created this platform to manage the data of criminals and retrieve it when needs arises. And we have also added glimpse of all over data in the graphical method which becomes easier for cop`s to know the current crime records.

We have used mainly used technology like ReactJs, Firebase , javascript, nodeJs and various Opensource technologies to build this web application and API`s to fetch real and accurate data of criminals in india.

Our web application is based on the Track-5 problem statement which is given in the HACKMANTHAN hackethon. This application is created with the terms and conditions given by them and also taking a real world problem in the our mind we have completed this project.</p>
